It aligns with the company's mission to provide high-quality education services and resources while operating efficiently and competitively in the market.
## Prerequisites
Jupyter Notebook
## Data
Data being used is 'Leads.csv' 
## Model
Machine Learning Model build for the problem is the Logistic Regression .
## Observations
The logistic regression model predicts the probability of the Target variable having a certain value, rather than predicting the value of the target variable directly. Then a cutoff of probability is used to obtain the predicted value of the target variable.
Here the logistic regression model is used to predict the probability of conversion of a customer.

Final Logistic Regression model is built with 14 features.
Top three features contributing in lead conversion are-
